        <h4> Why Learn To Code? </h4>
        <p>
          Around May of last year I started seriously considering learning how to code. People sometimes ask why - I think there are several reasons. The most important is that I've <a href="travel">witnessed firsthand </a> the power of the internet to transform lives across the world. I taught 400 students in China who had never seen a Westerner before. Nevertheless, they discussed their world using metaphors taken from "The Titanic", "Forrest Gump" ('life is like a box of chocolates...'), and Disney movies. They had access to those movies through the internet. Those same students, almost all of whom are from extremely poor and rural households, can access life-changing educational platforms provided by the world's top universities - something that they could never have dreamed of even five years ago. Figuring out how to enrich those kinds of connections is one of the most noble professions I think anyone can pursue.

        <h4> Dev Bootcamp </h4>
        <p>
          I read about <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in a newspaper article and sat on it for a few months, toying with the idea. Finally, I decided to take the plunge and apply. As part of the application process they asked me to go through <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/"> Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>. I had to google search how to open the terminal, so while it may seem amazingly simple to an experienced programmer, simply figuring out how to move files around from the terminal required study.
        </p>
        <p>
          I survived the tutorial and was accepted into the September class. It was the single most intense educational experience of my life. I've taken a course at the University of Cambridge, wrote the syllabus for my own course in a discipline outside of my major at Davidson and took it one-on-one with a professor, and have always had an easy time in school. Not this time. On our fourth day, we tackled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> in Ruby. The next day, we tackled a Sudoku solver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of a few months, we covered Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, TDD, Active Record, Git, jQuery, HAML, SASS, SQL (PostgreSQL and Sqlite), and Heroku. It was exhilerating and exhausting - pulling 90 hour weeks was the bare minimum. It was all worth it because at the end of the day, we walked out of the program able to <span class="emphasize">build things that matter</span>.
        </p>
        <h4> Gottman Project </h4>
        <p>
          As a capstone event for Dev Bootcamp, we gathered into teams of four to five and chose projects that we wanted to build in seven days. I was on a project that had a real client, <a href="http://www.gottman.com/">The Gottman Institute</a>, and our task was to put a <a href="
          http://young-mesa-8988.herokuapp.com"> 200 page survey</a> online. The survey is proprietary as is the code, so I can't provide a link to our repository on GitHub, but it was an ambitious and well-executed project. Our algorithm had to handle a highly inconsistent scoring system, requiring a data schema of 25 tables. Since the survey is designed to augment a clinician's work with a couple, it had to be designed for three levels of users - administrators, clinicians, and couples - with different levels of access. For legal reasons the only people who have access to couples' responses are their own clinicians, for example. Clinicians can add a couple simply by entering an email address into a field - everything else is automated. The same is true for an administrator adding a clinician, along with the capacity to freeze or unfreeze accounts and the cascading levels of access for the users beneath them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our survey will be used by thousands of clinicians worldwide and is currently in alpha testing. It amazes me to consider how far we progressed in such a short period of time. It will always be difficult to explain just how challenging, exhausting, stimulating and, ultimately, life-altering my experience at Dev Bootcamp was. Some things, maybe most things, have to be experienced to be truly understood - Dev Bootcamp is certainly one of them. The experience of it will always be with me.
