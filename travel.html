        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
          Travel has enriched my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no way to describe adequately what it feels like to be truly immersed in a culture where there is extraordinarily little common ground for perspectives and gestures. I've been extremely lucky to have had the opportunities I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first memories are from Saudi Arabia, where my family lived for four years (I was 5-9 years old). We lived there in the early 1990s when the world was very different than it is today and our whole family enjoyed the experience (even my mother). We then moved all over the place in the USA, winding up in Chicago for a while.
        </p>
        <h4> China </h4>
        <p>
          When I graduated from college in 2009, I knew that I wanted to go to China.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Beijing olympics electrified my desire to learn more about the awakening dragon. Naturally, the China I found in reality did not resemble the China of my imagination in almost any way. There is no way that it could have: it is a culture with 5,000 years of written history. It is old enough to have a cyclical collective memory through the twists and turns of its past.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a real thrill being on a plane with a one way ticket to a country of 1.3 billion people and you don't know a single person on the other end. It's terrifying and exhilerating. You won't get much sleep on the plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I taught English at Xinyu University in Jiangxi Province. My 400 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewguard/9658573859/"> students </a> were terrified of me and I was terrified of them at first, but we survived. Figuring out how to teach them was a challenge. Not only did I have no training as a teacher whatsoever, I had to navigate profound cultural barriers. China has a face-based culture, which makes teaching English as a foreign language a uniquely challenging endeavor. In grossly over-simplified terms, in face based cultures a very high value is placed on not making mistakes in public because they reflect poorly on the person making them and their family as well. Of course, the key element to learning how to speak a new language is the willingness to make at least 1000 mistakes a day in a very public manner so those are contradictory impulses at work. It took a lot of patience, self-discovery, and trial and error to create an environment where students felt comfortable making necessary mistakes but it was worth the effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience in China was not exactly fun. I met some great people and certainly had fun moments, but more than anything else I remember the extraordinary culture shock of living there and the daily challenge of connecting. The environmental, political, and cultural shock cannot be underestimated, particularly once you get past the major cities. However, it was also the year in my life where I grew the most personally and learned the most about how the world is not small or flat, as is fashionable to say now.
        </p>
        <h4>Argentina</h4>
        <p>
          After China, I returned to the New World (if Europe is the Old World, I guess that makes China the Really, Really Old World). I taught English at IBM Argentina in Buenos Aires after an interlude in Georgia. My year in Buenos Aires was amazing. The people, the culture, the language, the great friends - it was the kind of experience that I hope everyone gets to have in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a combination of new-world beauty and crushing poverty, anger, frustration, and decay in Buenos Aires. To me, above all else, Buenos Aires feels like a decaying world-class city. It is passionate, loud, and proud of its own contradictions. Walking down the streets, decades-old buses chug by, emitting clouds of black smog as scores of beautiful women saunter down the streets, dressed up in full make-up and high-heels, smoking a cigarette. On the same crowded streets, homeless people permanently reside at various shelters along the sidewalk, normally keeping to themselves. <a href="http://andrew-guard.blogspot.com/2012/04/buenos-aires.html"> More here about Buenos Aires in general from my travel blog. </a>
        </p>
        <h4>Latin America </h4>
        <p>
          While living in and breathing in Buenos Aires, my good friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewguard/7181759764/in/set-72157632029190328/">Kyle Horne and I</a> kept talking about traveling through the rest of Latin America. Our friends came from Colombia, Peru, Chile and many places in between and beyond - they made us realize that Latin America is a huge place of over 500 million people with diverse languages, customs, and geographies. We decided to pack our backpacks and go check it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          In six months, we backpacked through Patagonia in Argentina and Chile, hiked the Andes Mountains in Bolivia and Peru, explored the Amazon jungle, and spent two weeks in the driest desert in the world. We explored the mines in Potosi, called "The Mountain that Eats Men" for the 8 million people who have died inside of it since the Spaniards conquered it in the 1500s. We met great people along the way, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewguard/8024588829/in/set-72157635348396572"> Don O'Connor</a>, an awesome Irishman who joined us for 3 months (and even visited the States!). We were priveleged to truly explore the astonishing cultural and geographical diversity of Latin America.

        <h4> Conclusion </h4>
        <p>
          A blog of my trip through Latin America can be found <a href="http://andrew-guard.blogspot.com/"> here</a> and my pictures are all on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewguard/sets/">flickr</a>. I'm always happy to talk about more specifics if anyone is interested for whatever reason - there are plenty of stories to tell.
